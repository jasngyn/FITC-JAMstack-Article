## What is the Session Title?

The session I watched was the 'State of the JAMstack Oct 2020 Keynote, Matt Biilman of Netlify'. In all honesty, I don't know much about JAMstack other than it's designed to make th web faster, more secure and easier to scale. It also prebuilt into static pages already as well. I'm hoping to learn what newer things JAMstack has to offer, and how fast it is compared to it's competitors such as React or WordPress.

## Reversing the Flow

From the session, I learned something called reversing the flow. This is interesting as Matt explains, "it's reversing the flow away from the central request response cycle". SO the way JAMstack structures their application and the way its built for the web was basically a request would come in to a web server in some specific data sender and would talk to the application server then that application would connect to something like a search engine or different API's. Also being more focused on routing, redirect rules, and proxying.

## Shortening the Distance

Another thing I learned is how JAMstack is shortening the process from the user to the pre-built front-end. Ways they'd do this is by pre-built assets served closer to the user, api services closer to the user and no more app server. This way the user can just talk directly to all the different API's and services instead of going through the whole request response cycle that depends on their centralized application. Being a new web designer learning code, this would definitely help me and newer coders understand the process of coding and doing things easier rather than learning a bunch of steps that can be done in a much easier and faster way.

## Specialized Databases

So I learned that there is general compute and general storage that was used before. In each, general compute held cms, search, authentication and payment whereas general storage held content, search, user and orders. But now, with new specialized databases such as Contentful, Algolia, Auth0 and Shopify. So there is no more data modelling you can just put your users in the specialized databases and those platforms would already have a format to help with your specific needs. My opinion on these is that they're definitely useful.
